                <h2>But how do we get these results?</h2>
                <p>
                    Training kids is not a days job.. <br><br>

                    And getting qualified teachers to handle the job is another struggle,
                    as many of them are just after the salary... <br><br>

                    And the quality of training for teachers have greatly reduced.<br><br>

                    If everything is in check, we have other factors battling with our students attention like:
                </p>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Short video content on Social Media that consume their time and shortens their attention span</li>
                    <li>Video games, and TV shows etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                They come to school uninterested in learning, distracted and with little or no attention span in class..<br>
                But how do we handle this menance reducing the impact of our teaching on this children. How do we <br><br>

                It's simple, but not so simple for people who are not using our tools.<br><br>

                First our approach to learning is practical..

                <p> 
                    Chances are high you will forget about 80% of what you heard today within the next 48hours<br>
                    And if your student should have to choose between a book and a video game or even Social Media, 
                    chances are high they pick the second option..<br>
                    Not all but, but majority..
