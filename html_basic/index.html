        <h2>But how do we get these results?</h2>
        <p>
            Training kids is not a days job.. <br><br>

            And getting qualified teachers to handle the job is another struggle,
            as many of them are just after the salary... <br><br>

            And the quality of training for teachers have greatly reduced.<br><br>

            If everything is in check, we have other factors battling with our students attention like:
        </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Short video content on Social Media that consume their time and shortens their attention span</li>
                <li>Video games, and TV shows etc.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            They come to school uninterested in learning, distracted and with little or no attention span in class..<br>
            But how do we handle this menance reducing the impact of our teaching on this children. How do we <br><br>
            
            It's simple, but not so simple for people who are not using our tools.<br><br>
            
            First our approach to learning is practical..

            Chances are high you will forget about 80% of what you heard today within the next 48hours<br>
            And if your student should have to choose between a book and a video game or even Social Media, 
            chances are high they pick the second option..<br>
            Not all but, but majority..

            <h3>Our Unique Mechanism</h3>
        <p>
            The part of the brain responsible for this distraction is called the... and this is how it works.
            Now our learning tools use this same technology, video games and social media use to hook user to 
            hook learners to the app and make them addicted to learning, in a way that they don't need 
            to cram loads of information, but learn by doing.  focus on learning by doing,
